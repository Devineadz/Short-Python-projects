# Short-Python-projects
This repository includes shorter projects and assignments made with Python

Filters.py includes some basic filters used in image processing, mostly implemented without libraries (eg. openCV):
- Resize function to resize an image to be n size smaller
- Gaussian filter implementation
- Sobel filters for Sx and Sy
- Orientation map using Sobel filters
- Magnitude which calculates gradients magnitude using the Sobel filters
